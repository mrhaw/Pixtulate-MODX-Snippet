Pixtulate-MODX-Snippet
======================

Simple code to apply this awesome API on pictures in MODX.
First sign up and get your domain and choose img source. 
Then either edit the snippet code or set as a parameter.

For simplicity snippet uses the same parameters as the API.

If just called [!pixtulate!] 
it is using the demo picture. 

> For empty width &w=`` the snippet automatically detects and set size
iphone/android mobile 	>> 	400
android/ipad tablet 	>> 	600
laptop 					>> 	800
//edit this or set a override value for width.

Pixtulate is also planning to share Responsive Javascript that makes
this the most bulletproof solution for image handling ever.
Keep an eye on their website!
