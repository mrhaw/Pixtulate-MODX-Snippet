Pixtulate-MODX-Snippet
======================

Simple code to apply this awesome API on pictures in MODX.
First sign up and get your domain and choose img source. 
Then either edit the snippet code or set as a parameter.

For simplicity snippet uses the same parameters as the API.

If just called [!pixtulate!] 
it is using the demo picture. 

> For empty width &w=`` the snippet automatically detects and set size
iphone/android mobile 	>> 	400
android/ipad tablet 	>> 	600
laptop 					>> 	800
//edit this or set a override value for width.

Plenty of awesome JavaScript to further use. Pixtulate is about sharing 
Responsive Javascript for use to use! :)
